    <h1>How to do a minestrone soup</h1>
        <img src="../images/minestrone.webp" alt="Minestrone soup">
    <h3>Description</h3> 
        <p>I made this homemade minestrone soup after becoming tired of the excess salt 
            <br>
            and lack of veggies in canned ones. I based this recipe off of the delicious, 
            <br>
             vegetable-rich minestrone served at Sheepherder's Inn in Sacramento, California.</p> 
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
                <li>5 carrots, sliced</li>
                <li>4 cups tomato sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups fresh or frozen green beans, cut into 1 ½-inch pieces</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Sauté garlic in hot oil until fragrant,
                    <br> 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add celery and carrots; sauté for 1 to 2 minutes</li>
                <li>Pour in tomato sauce, broth, and water; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Add red wine; reduce heat to low.</li>
                <li>Stir in zucchini, spinach, green beans, kidney beans, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer until soup is heated through, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Cook seashell pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet
                    <br> firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place 2 tablespoons cooked pasta into individual serving bowls. Ladle soup over pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
